# Mobile_like_dislike_classification
This is classification problem for Mobile based on the Rating given by the people. 
It is solved by using MP Neuron and Perceptron.

Using MP Neuron the model achieved nearly 70% and 73% accuracy on train and test dataset respectively. 
Using Perceptron learning algorithm the model achieved approximately 85% and 79% accuracy on train and test dataset respectively.
The Perceptron learning algorithm can achieve more accuracy by tuning the Hyperparameters - Epochs and Learning Rate.
